## **Monthly Billing**

The goal is to have all projects on Productivity ready by the beginning of the month, so they could be processed soon after.

Review means:

1. Going over the hours making sure nothing seems out of the ordinary \(wrong submission of hours, or some nasty Productivity bug\)

2. Making sure the titles of the issues seem right, without spelling mistakes, or titles that are not client-friendly "Starting at window to think about the problem" is better replaced with "Planning of solution".

For some issues, a PM may decide they would want from some hours not to be billed. As much as we'd want to always bill 100% of our efforts, we are aware that reality can be more complicated.

Those hours should be escalated. That is, as part of the review process the PM should write down in Slack \`\#account-managers\` the details, and address it to Amitai \(or Efrat is he's out\). This will either be followed with a discussion or an immediate approval / rejection.

Normally, if those are very few hours \(e.g. 5 hours out of 100h\) approval is likely to be granted without too much discussion.  
We believe that it should be in the PM's toolbox the capability of not charging a client.  
The reason not to charge a client would be for the benefit of the relation with the client. Sometimes, if there is a clear mistake from our side we wouldn't want to have the client pay for it.

So it's important to remember that if there should be some discussion about non-billable hours it should be done before the 1st. That is, on the 1st the non-billable hours \(if any\) should have been already approved.

For cases where the 1st isn't on Monday-Thursday, Productivity should be ready by:

| **1st of the month** | **US Projects** | **IL Projects** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Friday** | **Friday, 1st.** | **Thursday, 30th** |
| **Saturday** | **Monday, 3rd.** | **Sunday, 2nd.** |
| **Sunday** | **Monday, 2nd.** | **Sunday, 1st.** |



## **Billing by Milestone**

Some projects are billed based on milestone. The milestone's end date is registered in the related Productivity project.

Anyone can open the projects in Productivity with the end date for each project/ milestone. However, Orit should be notified as-well via Slack \`\#account-managers\`, so the end date will be inserted in the \`Project Timeline\` calendar and will be considered as the deadline - the day that the client accepts it for their review.

If the PM understands at some point, that a deadline might not be reached its original date, it should be escalated to Amitai \(or Efrat is he's out\).  
A deadline can only be changed after it was escalated and approved. Once approved, it needs to be changed also in On Productivity as well as \`Project Timeline\` calendar, therefore, an alert to Orit is needed.

The goal is to have the project on Productivity reviewed on the day after itâ€™s sent to acceptance for the client.

Notifying whether it was accepted or rejected by the client should be done in Slack on \`\#account-managers\`

So if the deadline is the 15th, and it was submitted for acceptance to the client \(which is likely to be in US timezone\), then the PM is responsible for having Productivity reviewed by the 16th.

It's possible that the client will have some rejections, and in that case, a 2nd review will be done again after re-submitting, but hopefully, that would not be common.

In case there was indeed a rejection, we'd need to setup a new deadline \(with Amitai's approval of the date\), and repeat the process.

We expect the client to accept the milestone in up to 4 business days. So it means that on the 18th, once we got a green light, we'd send the invoice.

For cases where the end-date is on Friday, then the Productivity review should be done on the following Monday.
