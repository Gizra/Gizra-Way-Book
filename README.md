# The Gizra Way Definitive Guide

This book is the definitive guide to the Gizra Way, and it tries to encapsulate both the technical  
aspects and our culture.

The idea is a place for every Gizra employee to go - to better understand what is expected of them and the processes that encapsulate that. To effectively do this, we document only processes that have been tested and work. We try our best to cut out fluff and give the bottom line.

Even though this guide is public to the entire world, we are not afraid of exposing our unpleasant mistakes, or touch on sensitive subjects. Actually, we like it that way because it is also part of the Gizra Way - that slight uncomfortable feeling means we are challenging ourselves. We found that we learn and improve way better and way faster once we are outside of our comfort zone, and share our experiences with others.

## How and What to Document

1. Document the bottom line. Include only processes that have been tested and work. Cut out fluff.
2. Iterate. If this document is not a live document, its useless.
3. For every standard provide a way, preferably automatic, to monitor it.
