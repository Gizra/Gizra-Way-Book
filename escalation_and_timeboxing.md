# Escalation and Timeboxing

The goal of this chapter is to clarify Gizra’s core project management processes, and the roles of the Account Managers, Team Leads, Developers, and QA.

## Activity Process

### Create a weekly plan

At the begging or end of the week, the Account Manager creates a weekly plan and they, with or without the Team Leads, assign the tasks to the developers. Every Developer gets their tasks for the next week.

The priority is indicated by how high up the task is on the list.

QA's list of activities is an exception. They have their own board and it is based on an ongoing list - not a weekly plan. The goal is to clear the list as quickly as possible per the priorities set.

### Review and prepare the tasks

1. **Understand the task**. Ask questions until you do.  
2. **Check the timeboxing**. If it doesn’t make sense to you, communicate that to your team lead.  
3. **Outline the solution** in advance if you are not sure about it so your team lead can review it.

## Timeboxing

1. Timeboxing is the **amount of time set to complete a task**.
2. It is our most important tool to manage our project, and have real-time monitoring.
3. Timeboxing is based on an **average** skilled developer - _not_ according to who will be doing the task.
4. **Escalating in the timebox.** An update to an issue should happen about **once an hour** \(update/ image/ git commit\). If you see that you are reaching the timebox, don't wait to the last minute - reach out to your team lead \(technical stuff\) or account manager \(spec\) and communicate it, via a comment on GitHub.

## Reporting in Productivity

1. Be accurate in reporting! We need real numbers to help us as a company do our best. It's not about nit picking with employees.
2. **Update every day**. This is important for our reporting with the clients.
3. Expectations: in Gizra's 9 hour days, we expect to see 6-8 hours of productive time. Yes, take breaks as needed but when you work, be focused.
4. How to report your work is detailed in the [Reporting in Productivity](https://www.thegizraway.com/productivity.html) chapter.

## Team Leads

### Task process

Know the activity process, monitor it, and clear away as many obstacles as possible - beginning of the week is best. Review the solution outlines written by the developers, and give your input if necessary.

### Escalation process

Make sure you don't spend too much time along with the dev trying to fix it. 15 minutes are probably the maximum - after that your time should be calculated as part of the task. That is, if you and the developer sat together for 30 minutes, then both of you should clock it in Productivity.

### Feedback

Your interaction with the developers is very important.  When a developer does something right, remember to provide them positive feedback - they really need to hear it.  When the developer messes up, tell them - getting real time feedback to where they need to improve is helpful for them and for Gizra. If you see that you need to correct/remind a developer repeatedly on the same mistake, it's time for you to escalate this to Amitai.
