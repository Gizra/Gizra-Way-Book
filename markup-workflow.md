# Markup workflow

Markup is the process which we take design sketch and convert them to Html/Css files.  
The purpose of this chapter is to understand the process of creating markup with outsourcing providers.

Prepare the instruction file

Create an explanation file contains the design sketch and instructions to the Markup developer.  
you can see example [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUch-TRll47WAbuLORqHeElqrEHolMTPg6kFnU97ItY/edit#gid=0).

* Be sure to consider all elements of the sketch.
* If there is a separate design for mobile, be sure to refer to it.
* If there are already known css classes, mention them, so the markup developer can use them.
* Point out the various devices which need to be checked.

### Post the job offer

Post the job offer at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/c/3474169/jobs/new).

The job offer should contain:

* Explanation file.
* PDF file\(s\) contain design screenshots.
* PSD file contains design layers.
* [Markup guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mDgml5u-LII6YYS0c0D3koVjVRZe3FUCYLcaaJSKhA/edit)

### The Markup developer start working

The developer who takes the jobs start working on it and ask for clarification if needed.  
When they finished, they post the Html/Css files.

### QA - check the work

Deliver the Html/Css files to our QA staff, and they continue the communication with the Markup developer until the job is done to our satisfaction.

### Approve the work

When the work is done, approve it in Upwork so the developer will get payment.
