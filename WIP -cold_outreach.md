#Cold Outreach
Reaching out by email to someone you don't know and does not know you can sometimes be disheartening. However, there are ways to increase the chances of getting a response and that is by finding the right person to contact, finding their contact information, and engaging them with effective emails.

## The right person
Finding the right persons to engage with is critical for the success of the sales process. We wat to make sure that we are not wasting effort and enrgy going after somoeone who someone who doesn't have the power to buy our services or has low influence on the purchasing decisions. 

### Roles in Buying Decision 

There are few types of personas in the selling process. Identified through lead qualification.

**Influencer** - Works directly with the decision makers (above or below or outside the organization) and their opinion is respected. Their influence tends to be informal but powerful. 

**Decision Maker** - The person who has the power to decide on the deal. They may not be the person who signs off on it (Approver) but does have the formal responsibility on the budget level.

**Champion** - Someone who is willing to actively fight for Gizra. It can be a 'Decision Maker' or an active Influencer. 

**Blocker/Gatekeeper** - The person who keeps away time wasters from the people above. The person who answers the phone - the boss's assistant.

### Engaging each role 
**Influencer** - Key Influencers are important for success. Try and get the key Influencers to actively support and convert them into a Champion. The first contact with an organization can be done with them. Keep engaging with this person through out the sales process and when managing the account.  Try to find more than one person to support the process.

**Decision Maker** - Best if we can  get the Decision Maker to actively drive the project and to commit to Gizra. If the Decision Maker and the Approver is the same person that makes the process easier and quicker. 

**Champion** - Try and build a "champion" from an influencer and someone who understands the buying process.  It can be someone you know (worked with us in the past) and use them as an active influencer from the get-go.

**Blocker/Gatekeeper** - Be nice to them and try to get information on who is the decision maker is how they can be reached. Do not spend time on technical information.  

### Techniques for finding right person.  

**Company website**
Check the 'About' section of the company website. Often there are sections such as: Team, Management, Staff. Try to locate the right person on the lists. 
The right person to contact can be: CEO, CTO, CDO (Chief Digital Officer) ,CMO (Chief Marketing Officer), VP marketing etc. 

Note: When it comes to large public organizations, such as in HigerEd and Governments, it is worth taking the time to look for the purchasing department page on site - it can help understand the purchasing process. 

**LinkedIn** If the website does not include this information, LinkedIn is a good next step. Find the Company page in LinkedIn and click on the number of people that work there in order to view a list. The list can be very long, so it is a good idea to use the filters (filter by location, current company and Industry). Also try to search for the company name + CEO, CTO or Marketing. 

**Phone** Make a few calls to the organization and try to figure out who the decision marker is. What department owns the website?

**Just ask ** At small firms it might be good idea to shoot an email or a phone call asking 
> “Hi, I just wanted to know if you were responsible for the company website/ Digital Projects/ Web present/ CMS / Development team.

In an email always ask who else you can send the message to. 


##Reaching out to the Target
Now, after we ID the target, we need to find his/her contact information. This part can be a little tricky sometimes and time consumings. The best way is to find someone in your network that can refer you to your target. But if there is no real connection between you, fear not - below there are few technics to find your target's email address that will work 90% of the time.
 
###Referrals 

**Your Network**

Try to find someone you know within your network that can send an intro email to your target person. This is the best way to get an answer back. 
An email requesting an intro should be short and include a message that they can easily forward. 

Example: 

> Hi XXX 
The work that we have done with the UN can be very relevant for YYY. I would love to present them Gizra and work with them.  Do you know someone there that you can put me in touch with? / Can you put me in touch with Mr. ZZZ there? 				
A brief description of Gizra and what we do/what we have done with the UN  is below this message. (for an easy copy/paste) 
Thanks, AAA <p>----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Gizra  is a Web development company specializing in complex web solutions. They have been working with agencies in the UN to develop their site, review their code and cut maintenance and hosting cost in more than half. They also work with Harvard university, the EU and more. It will be great if this service can do the same for YYY

Once the intro email was sent by your contact - send a follow email which looks like : 

> Thanks you XXX (move to BCC)
HI YYY, Nice to e-meet you. Are you available for a 10 min call later this week?  	 	 

**From within the company**

Get friendly with the gatekeepers or try to gain influence on the  influencers and get them to refer you directly to the decision marker or use their name when speaking / emailing: 

> “John from IT Thought that I should speak to you about our services as you are the person who makes the decision." 

###Finding the target’s email address

This can be the most time consuming and frustrating step. With the right tools and common sense you will most likely be ablr to find 95% of the email addresses you need. 

**It is out there**
* In cases that this is a marketing or communication person, there is a good chance that their email address is listed on the organization site. Check the press releases section or other publications.
* For NGOs and Non-profit organizations, look for the staff page or leadership page.  More often than not, the complete contact info is listed there. 
* Same goes for university or government sites - look for the directory or use the search.
* Another trick is to search for the person's name in google with or without the @ sign or the word “email.” 

**Find out the email formula used in that organization**  

There are few tools that can help: 

* Look for a colleague email address - figure out your target email address  from somebody else's email address. Maybe a marketing person, a liaison, sales director. 
* Search google for “@comapnydomian” - give it a shot, it may work. 
* Check Whois - sites such as [whoisology.com](whoisology.com) holds information on the person who registered the domain (name and email). Very often this is someone from the organization and you can figure out the email template from it.
* Emails4Corp - A free resource providing a listing of corporations. If you are lucky the company you're researching is listed there.
* Guess and test it I - There are sites that let you test and verify email addresses. Enter the email address and receive a feedback if this a valid working email. This is not 100% reliable.  Note that not all domains allow email verification or there is a mail server that is set to "catch all ” emails. (Meaning: the server does not reject emails but there is no guarantee that someone will ever read them.) [Mailtester.com](Mailtester.com), [kickbox.io](kickbox.io) , [app.neverbounce.com](app.neverbounce.com) 
* Guess and test it II. Install Rapportive – [Rapportive](https://rapportive.com/) is a free add-on for chrome+ Gmail. When you type an email address into a new message, Rapportive opens up a sidebar that gives you the LinkedIn information of that contact. It displays information from the LinkedIn profile and other social media sites.
Rapportive is a great tool to find the validity of emails when reaching out to new contacts. Just enter the guessed email address in the TO field. If the person's picture and info is displayed on Rapportive's side bar - bingo. If not, it still can be the person's email but not the one they use for their LinkedIn account. 

### Technology to track your email
**Yesware** - Track when and where an email was opened. 
By knowing if an email was opened or not you can decide when to send the follow-up email or make the phone call. Yesware allows you to:

* Know for sure if your email was read or is sitting in an inbox unopened.
* Track how many time an email  was opened and if it was opened by more than one person. An email that has been opened by one or more device across a long period of time - can indicate that there is some kind of interest or at least it sparked internal conversation. 
* Hit when you notice activity on an old email - If you notice that an old email that was sent, was opened again, that may mean that the client is now ready to connect. Good to be on the offense here and send a casual reminder email.
* Use Yesware templates to speed up sending out cold email . Try different templates and different subject lines and use Yesware reports to track which template works better - higher open rate and response rate. 
* Send email later - You can use Yesware to send an email in specific time and date. You can schedule a follow respond to go out automatically after X amount of days if there is no answer to the previous email.
* Reminders -  Yesware can re-surface an email to your inbox if you need a reminder. You can use it as a reminder to send out a follow up. 

Note - Yesware displays the IP of the device that opened the email. If there are more then on devices listed , there is a good chance that the original recipient FW the email to someone else in the team. This can indict that there is some interest. 

Keep in mind that this is not 100% reliable. Some email services hide images by defaults from unknown users or hide the IP, which can lead to false  results. 

## E-mail strategy
Being able to write a cold email that will to be opned and read is not an easy task. There is no one single tamaplte that works each time and it changes acording to who do you send the email to and what is that you are offerning. 
Below are few tips for what can be a successful cold sales email campaign. Again, there is no magic and even if you had written the most perfect email, it still might not be opned from reasons that not in your power to change. 
A good start point to think on a stratgey is to ***put yourself in the reader shoes*** 


### Subject line

I found that the most effective subject line includes the company name and Gizra. example: XXX<> Gizra. 
Other good options are: "XXX suggested that I should contact you" - when it is a referral.  
If the person has a blog you can write - “About your last blog post" or "Watched your talk last night " 
The most important thing - make sure it does not look like a spam email. 

**HigherEd**: Including Harvard in the subject line can work or can scare away as well, depending on the receiver. 

Here is a [good article for do's and don't](http://www.yesware.com/blog/email-subject-line-analysis/).  

### Make it personal

The people that we targets receive a lot of emails. If you make a connection with them from the start and make it relevant, they will keep reading.

**Homework** - spend a little time to learn something about the target from a blog post, or award they won lately. Refer to it in the first paragraph. Write them something about them and not about yourself first.  

###Keep it short
One paragraph, maybe 2. Split up the content for easy reading. Test the length on your phone and make sure the message can be read in 2 scrolls.

###Close with an actionable follow up

“Do you have time to chat about it next week Monday or Tuesday? 
“How does your calendar looks like for the next couple of days? 
“Who on you team is the appropriate person to send this email to”? 
Say thanks and respect other people's time - they will be more likely to help and respond. 

###Bringing it all together

**A personal opening** (optional):  I love your blog post, I see that you went to X conference , congrats on a award.

**Explain the reason you are contacting them** <br>
* 
A Reason to contact Such as: “ I notice that your site is built with Drupal 6". “We have done similar project with XX “, “I see that you are attending conference X"  
* 
It can be a more of generic reason such as a the "Fit pitch" (there is a better way to do projects) or a Gizra into (I would like to introduce you to Gizra - an elite development agency.)

**Who you are and what is Gizra** <br>

> My name is XXXX and I am Gizra's XXX. Gizra is a web development company specializing in complex web solutions with clients such as The UN, Harvard University, and European Commission. 

**Pique Curiosity** <br>
* 
Share a relevant case study or content - 
“I wanted to share with you this case study which describes the work we have been doing / have done with our strategic partner X (Harvard, Taglit, EU ). I am confident that you will find it relevant for your needs."

* 
"We know how to implement projects on time, on budget and with happy users. - I would like to share with you how.
* 
"We are an elite Drupal agency with clients such as X,Y,Z (competitors or peers) - and I would love to hear about the project you are doing." 
* 
*We will be at conference X and would love to meet you."

* try and make it as relevant as possible and include metrics or a good reason for them to hear more . Examples: how much money Harvard or Taglit is saving; the freedom that open source provides; quick results thanks to the Gizra Way approach 

**Close with a clear ask**

A) Are you available to chat for 10 min next week Monday? 
B) I will be in LA next week - would you like to meet?
C) Who should I contact ?
