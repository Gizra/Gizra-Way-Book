Working with QA



# Dev-QA interface

---

In Gizra QA is an inherent part of the dev process. An issue goes through the following life cycle:



1. issue development
2. **simple test development**
3. code review
4. CI
5. merge
6. deploy to dev/test
7. **manual QA**
8. deploy to LIVE
9. **additional automation**

In this chapter, we will describe the process that creates and defined steps 2, 7, and 9 above.

**Simple test development:**

Responsible: the developer who developed the issue

After each issue development, and as part of the code that encapsulates the issue, the developer creates at least 1 simple test for the issue. No issue development is considered complete until a test is created for it, and the test code is reviewed in the code review session \(3\).



**Manual QA:**
