# Reporting in Productivity

Correct reporting is a crucial part in a project’s life. We use the reporting for 2 main reasons:

1. Project Reporting. Especially for time and material contracts, at any given moment, clients ask for their project’s
work report.  This helps them track their budget. It is crucial that hours are reported on a daily basis - hence, you
receive a daily reminder to log in your hours from Productivity.

2. Internal. Productivity is an important tool to track the progress and status of our projects.  It also functions as a
mechanism for improvement by raising flags to areas that require further analysis. For example, did we assign the right
timebox for an issue. We need real numbers to help us as a company do our best. It's not about nit picking with
employees.

## Reporting Options

1. Development - All activities by Team Leads and Developers. Please note that this includes project environment setup and installation - it should be reported against a project issue opened by the Account Manager.

2. QA - All activities by the QA team.

3. Management - All activities by Account Managers.

4. Support - This is a very specific activity and the people assigned to this will know that they are working under the “support” function.

5. Training - All activities by Trainer


## What about the "other?"

There are various activities, such as meetings and IT problems, that don’t fit nicely under a client projects - they don’t require reporting.  

For our hourly employees, based on past reporting, we will add 10% to their total reported development.  
For our salaried employees, this is already taken into consideration.
