# Reporting in Productivity

Correct reporting is a crucial part in a project’s life. We use the reporting for 2 main reasons:

1. Project Reporting. Especially for time and material contracts, at any given moment, clients ask for their project’s
work report.  This helps them track their budget. It is crucial that hours are reported on a daily basis - hence, you
receive a daily reminder to log in your hours from Productivity.

2. Internal. Productivity is an important tool to track the progress and status of our projects.  It also functions as a
mechanism for improvement by raising flags to areas that require further analysis. For example, did we assign the right
timebox for an issue. We need real numbers to help us as a company do our best. It's not about nit picking with
employees.
