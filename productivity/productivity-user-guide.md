# Reporting working hours

Before reporting, make sure you are on the right date.

The system automatically adds rows when you participant in an issue/PR in Github. The row provides all the details \(Project, Repo, Issue number, PR number, and description\). The time is presented as 0.00 and this is where you update the actual time you spent working on that issue/PR.

You can add/delete rows as you wish to reflect what you worked on.

Please make sure to add a separate row per each issue and report the work hours per issue/PR. This helps us analyze how many hours we have spent on a particular issue compared to the timeboxing. We use this information to improve our estimations for next time.

**Time off** - the gap between the potential and the total hours.

Out of **X** Hours, you reported **Y** Hours, which is **Z**% -

**X** - the reported hours in Timewatch \(attendance\) 

**Y** - the reported hours in Productivity \(work\)
