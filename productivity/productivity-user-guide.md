# Reporting your working hours

**Working hours need to be reported every day! **This [chapter](https://www.thegizraway.com/productivity.html) covers what requires reporting.

Before reporting, always make sure you are on the right date.

All your tracking are shown according to your personal timezone setting. To change your timezone click on the `user's timezone` link.

It is important to report your hours per issue/PR in github - each in a separate row. This helps us analyze how many hours we spent on a particular issue compared to the timeboxing. We use this information to improve our work and estimations.![](/images/productivity/report_working_hours.jpg)

To help, the system automatically adds rows for each issue/PR in Github that you participated in. The row provides all the details \(Project, Repo, Issue number, PR number, and description\). The time is presented as 0.00 and this is where you update the actual time you spent working on that issue/PR.

You should add/delete rows to accurately reflect what you worked on.

# TimeWatch

Israeli employees must report entry and exit at the beginning and end of each working day. If you need to go out in the middle of the day, you can report exit and then re-entry when you are back to work.

Go to TimeWatch tab.

**Reporting attendance hours**

Click on `Punch Now` to report entry. Your report line will appear in the table below. To report exit click again on `Punch Now`.

**Note:** if you intend to work on Municipality project, mark the Municipality checkbox before you hit Punch Now button.

Out of **X** Hours, you reported **Y** Hours, which is **Z**% -

**X** - the reported hours in Timewatch \(attendance\)

**Y** - the reported hours in Productivity \(work\)
