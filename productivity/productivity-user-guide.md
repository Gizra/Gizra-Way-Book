# Reporting working hours

**Working hours needs to be reported each day! **

Please [read](https://www.thegizraway.com/productivity.html) to know what needs to be report.

Before reporting, make sure you're on the right date, to avoid mistakes.

The system add row automatically when you are involved \(participant\) in issue/PR in Github. The row show all the details \(Project, Repo, Issue number, PR number and description\), only the time presented as 0.00. You need to update manually the actual time you have spent working on that issue/PR. 

Of course you can add/delete row as you wish, according to what you have worked on.

Please make sure to add a separate row to each issue and report the work hours per issue/PR. This helps us to analyze how many hours we have spent on a particular issue compared to the timeboxing, in order to improve our estimations for next time.
